$\textcolor{#246EAA}{\textsf{The dataset is about past loans, it includes details of 346 customers whose loans are already}}$
$\textcolor{#246EAA}{\textsf{paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields}}$:

|Effective_date |	When the loan got originated and took effects |
|Due_date |	Since itâ€™s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date |
|Age	 | Age of applicant |
